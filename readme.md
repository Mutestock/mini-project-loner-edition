<p> This project requires REST, SOAP and gRPC. </p>
<p> Since all of these technologies should be relatively universal and interoperable, we'll be making this assignment in various different languages and frameworks as an exercise </p>
<br>
<p> REST: Typescript (deno) </p>
<p> SOAP: C# </p>
<p> gRPC: Rust (tonic) </p>
<p> Migration: Python</p>
<p> Frontend: Typescript (Angular)</p>
