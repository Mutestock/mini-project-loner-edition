###### Installation & Deployment ######

The solution is at the time of writing this file deployed at:

front:
http://159.65.54.148:10050/

backend:
REST - http://159.65.54.148:10020
gRPC - http://159.65.54.148:10030
SOAP - http://159.65.54.148:10040


To run locally(requires docker & docker-compose):
docker-compose up

Github



###### Setup Description ######


There are multiple reasons why we've decided to solve the assignment like this

1: The education we're currently taking involves a lot of copying and pasting. We believe this is counterintuitive. We need to make our own solutions for the sake of learning.
2. Being able to use multiple tools and languages makes us more versatile as programmers.
3. Using multiple and completely different languages in the context of SOAP, REST and gRPC and being able to use them together cooperatively on the same platform (frontend Angular), 
    showcases the interoperability and independance of the technologies.
4. Creating the services like this allows us to easily reuse and expand them for future projects.
